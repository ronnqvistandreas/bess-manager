"""
Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Optimization.

This module implements a sophisticated dynamic programming approach to optimize battery
dispatch decisions over a 24-hour horizon, considering time-varying electricity prices,
solar production forecasts, and home consumption patterns.

UPDATED: Now captures strategic intent at decision time rather than analyzing flows afterward.

ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
The optimization uses backward induction dynamic programming to find the globally optimal
battery charging and discharging schedule. At each hour, the algorithm evaluates all
possible battery actions (charge/discharge/hold) and selects the one that minimizes
total cost over the remaining time horizon.

KEY FEATURES:
- 24-hour optimization horizon with perfect foresight
- Cost basis tracking for stored energy (FIFO accounting)
- Profitability checks to prevent unprofitable discharging
- Minimum profit threshold system to prevent excessive cycling for low-profit actions
- Multi-objective optimization: cost minimization + battery longevity
- Simultaneous energy flow optimization across multiple sources/destinations
- Strategic intent capture at decision time for transparency and hardware control

MINIMUM PROFIT THRESHOLD SYSTEM:
The minimum profit threshold prevents unprofitable battery operations through a post-optimization profitability gate.
After optimization completes, the total savings are compared against an effective threshold derived from the configured
value scaled proportionally to the remaining horizon fraction:

    effective_threshold = min_action_profit_threshold * max(THRESHOLD_HORIZON_FLOOR, horizon / total_periods)

- If total_savings >= effective_threshold: Execute the optimized schedule
- If total_savings < effective_threshold: Reject optimization and use all-IDLE schedule (do nothing)

The scaling ensures the bar is proportional to how much of the day remains. A run at midnight faces the full threshold;
a run at 20:00 with only 4 hours left faces roughly 1/6 of it. Without scaling, late-day runs are held to an
unreachable standard and legitimate evening discharge opportunities get blocked.

THRESHOLD_HORIZON_FLOOR (0.15) prevents the effective threshold from collapsing to near-zero at end of day, which
would allow the battery to cycle for trivially small gains in the final hour or two.

Configurable via battery.min_action_profit_threshold in config.yaml (in your currency).
Example: a threshold of 8.0 at 16:00 (8/24 remaining) becomes an effective threshold of 8.0 * 0.33 = 2.67

STRATEGIC INTENT CAPTURE:
The algorithm now captures the strategic reasoning behind each decision:
- GRID_CHARGING: Storing cheap grid energy for arbitrage
- SOLAR_STORAGE: Storing excess solar for later use
- LOAD_SUPPORT: Discharging to meet home load
- EXPORT_ARBITRAGE: Discharging to grid for profit
- IDLE: No significant activity

ENERGY FLOW MODELING:
The algorithm models complex energy flows where multiple sources can serve multiple
destinations simultaneously:
- Solar → {Home, Battery, Grid Export}
- Battery → {Home, Grid Export}
- Grid → {Home, Battery Charging}

OPTIMIZATION OBJECTIVES:
1. Primary: Minimize total electricity costs over 24-hour period
2. Secondary: Minimize battery degradation through cycle cost modeling
3. Constraints: Physical battery limits, efficiency losses, minimum SOC

RETURN STRUCTURE:
The algorithm returns comprehensive results including:
- Optimal battery actions for each hour
- Strategic intent for each decision
- Detailed energy flow breakdowns showing where each kWh flows
- Economic analysis comparing different scenarios
- All data needed for hardware implementation and performance analysis
