"""Growatt MIN inverter controller.

This module converts strategic intents from the DP algorithm into Growatt MIN-specific
Time of Use (TOU) intervals while meeting strict inverter hardware requirements.

PROBLEM STATEMENT & REQUIREMENTS:

Growatt inverters have strict hardware requirements that create operational challenges:
1. TOU segments must be in chronological order without overlaps (hardware requirement)
2. Maximum 9 TOU segments supported by inverter hardware
3. Frequent inverter writes should be minimized to reduce hardware stress
4. Past and future strategic periods can change dynamically throughout the day, but we only update future segments
5. Past time intervals should not be modified (unnecessary writes)
6. All segments must have unique, sequential segment IDs (1, 2, 3...)
7. Segment durations must align with full hour boundaries (e.g., 20:00-20:59)
8. Inverter default behavior is load_first - only create TOU segments to override this default
9. Only strategic periods (battery_first, grid_first) need explicit TOU segments
10. IDLE periods automatically use load_first behavior (no TOU segment required)

OBJECTIVES:

1. ZERO OVERLAPS: Guarantee no overlapping time intervals
2. CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER: Ensure segments are always in time sequence (1,2,3...)
3. MINIMAL WRITES: Only update future segments, preserve past segments unchanged
4. HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY: Respect 9-segment limit and ID requirements
5. DP ALIGNMENT: Use full hour boundaries to align with DP algorithm output

APPROACH:

Strategic intents (from DP algorithm) are converted to battery modes:
- GRID_CHARGING → battery_first (AC charging enabled)
- SOLAR_STORAGE → load_first (solar serves home first, excess to battery)
- LOAD_SUPPORT → load_first (discharging priority)
- EXPORT_ARBITRAGE → grid_first (export priority)
- IDLE → load_first (normal operation)

ALGORITHM:

1. Group consecutive hours by battery mode
2. Create TOU intervals only for non-"load_first" modes (battery_first, grid_first)
3. Use full hour boundaries (e.g., 20:00-20:59) to align with DP algorithm output
4. Preserve past intervals to minimize inverter writes
5. Assign sequential segment IDs to avoid conflicts

IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION:

Requirements compliance check:
✓ Zero overlaps: Uses hour boundaries (20:00-20:59, 21:00-21:59) - no overlap possible
✓ Chronological order: Final intervals sorted by start_time, sequential IDs assigned 1,2,3...
✓ Minimal writes: Preserves past intervals unchanged
✓ Hardware compatibility: Limits to max 9 segments, ensures unique sequential IDs
✓ DP alignment: Uses exact hour boundaries from DP algorithm
✓ Disabled segments are load_first: Time periods without TOU segments default to load_first
✓ Corruption recovery: Nuclear reset approach when chaos detected

CORRECT APPROACH: Only create TOU segments for strategic periods (battery_first, grid_first).
All other time periods automatically use load_first as inverter default behavior.

ROBUST RECOVERY: When TOU corruption detected (overlaps, wrong order, duplicates):
1. Log corrupted state for debugging
2. Clear all corrupted TOU intervals immediately
3. If strategic intents available, rebuild schedule immediately
4. System instantly returns to clean, working state

class GrowattMinController(InverterController):
    """Creates Growatt MIN inverter schedules using strategic intents from DP algorithm.

    This class manages the conversion between strategic intents and Growatt MIN-specific
    Time of Use (TOU) intervals. It uses the strategic reasoning captured at decision
    time in the DP algorithm rather than analyzing energy flows afterward.

    Strategic Intent → Inverter Behavior:

    GRID_CHARGING (battery_first, grid_charge=True, charge=100, discharge=0):
      Purpose: Charge battery from grid during cheap hours for later arbitrage.
      Flow: Grid → battery (AC charging). Grid → home. Battery does not discharge.

    SOLAR_STORAGE (load_first, grid_charge=False, charge=100, discharge=100):
      Purpose: Store excess solar for expensive evening hours while serving home load.
      Flow: Solar → home first, excess solar → battery. Battery discharges to cover
      any shortfall when home load exceeds solar production. Grid covers remainder.
      Uses load_first so solar serves home directly. discharge=100 allows the inverter
      to draw from battery whenever load exceeds solar, without importing from grid.

    LOAD_SUPPORT (load_first, grid_charge=False, charge=0, discharge=100):
      Purpose: Discharge stored energy to offset expensive grid consumption.
      Flow: Battery → home. Solar → home. Grid covers remainder if needed.
      Battery does not charge — energy is being spent, not accumulated.

    EXPORT_ARBITRAGE (grid_first, grid_charge=False, charge=0, discharge=100):
      Purpose: Export stored energy to grid during high sell-price hours.
      Flow: Battery → grid (export). Solar → grid. Grid may still serve home.

    IDLE (load_first, grid_charge=False, charge=100, discharge=0):
      Purpose: Normal operation when no active strategy is needed.
      Flow: Solar → home, excess solar → battery. Grid covers shortfall.
      Battery does not discharge. Unlike SOLAR_STORAGE, IDLE allows no discharge
      even to cover home load — the optimizer has decided no action is warranted.

    Design rationale — why SOLAR_STORAGE and IDLE differ from each other:

    SOLAR_STORAGE uses discharge=100 so the battery can cover home load when solar
    falls short, avoiding grid import during the charging window.
    IDLE uses discharge=0 because no optimization intent is active — the battery
    holds energy without any active strategy.

    Both use load_first because:

    1. Solar energy serving the home directly is always >= the value of routing it
       through the battery (which incurs cycle cost and conversion losses).
    2. If prices are cheap enough to justify prioritizing battery over home load,
       the DP algorithm should use GRID_CHARGING instead (battery_first + grid_charge),
       which charges from both solar and grid simultaneously.
    3. battery_first without grid_charge causes the inverter to route solar to the
       battery first, forcing unnecessary grid import to serve the home — a strictly
       worse outcome when there is excess solar.

    Therefore only GRID_CHARGING uses battery_first mode.
